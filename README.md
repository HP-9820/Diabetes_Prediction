# Diabetes Prediction  

This repository contains code and models developed to predict diabetes onset using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database**, which includes various health-related features to predict whether a person has diabetes.

## Overview  

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust model that accurately predicts whether a person has diabetes based on multiple health features such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, age, and more. The dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks and serves as a popular resource for educational purposes in machine learning.

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains 8 features and a target variable. Below is an explanation of the features:  

1. **Pregnancies**  
   Hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect insulin sensitivity, especially in women with multiple pregnancies.  

2. **Blood Glucose Level**  
   High blood sugar levels occur due to insulin resistance or insufficient insulin productionâ€”traits associated with diabetes.  

3. **Blood Pressure**  
   Hypertension can damage blood vessels, increasing the risk of diabetes-related complications such as kidney disease and retinopathy.  

4. **Skin Thickness**  
   Excess body fat, especially visceral fat, is a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.  

5. **Insulin**  
   Low insulin levels may indicate type 1 diabetes, while high levels often point to type 2 diabetes.  

6. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**  
   Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, promotes insulin resistance.  

7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**  
   A higher value suggests a stronger family history and genetic risk for developing diabetes.  

8. **Age**  
   Insulin production and sensitivity decline with age, increasing diabetes risk.  

In addition to the main dataset features, the project also considers auxiliary factors that are relevant to diabetes risk:  

9. **Hypertension**  
   Increases the risk of diabetes-related complications, particularly cardiovascular disease.  

10. **Heart Disease**  
   Diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis and other cardiac issues due to vascular damage.  

11. **Smoking History**  
   Nicotine reduces insulin sensitivity, and smoking promotes inflammation.  

12. **HbA1c Level**  
   High HbA1c levels confirm poor glucose regulation and increased risk of complications.

## Problem Statement  

The challenge is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not using the above features. Accurate predictions can facilitate early diagnosis and proper interventions, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and improved quality of life.
