Diabetes Prediction
This repository contains code and models developed to predict diabetes onset using machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various health-related features to predict whether a person has diabetes.

Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes based on multiple health features like glucose levels, insulin, BMI, age, and more. The dataset used is a popular dataset for binary classification tasks and is commonly used for educational purposes in the field of machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains 8 features and a target variable. The features include:

) Pregnancies- Hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect insulin sensitivity, especially in women with multiple pregnancies.

2) Blood Glucose Level- High blood sugar levels occur due to insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production - traits of diabetes.

3) Blood Pressure - Hypertension can damage blood vessels - diabetes, such as kidney disease and retinopathy.

4) Skin Thickness- Excess body fat, especially visceral fat, is a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

5) Insulin - Low insulin levels suggest diabetes type 1- point to type 2 diabetes.

6) BMI (Body Mass Index)- Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, promotes insulin resistance.

7) Diabetes Pedigree Function- A higher value suggests a stronger family history and genetic risk for developing diabetes.

8) Age- Insulin production and sensitivity decline with age, increasing diabetes risk.

9) Hypertension- diabetes-related complications, particularly cardiovascular disease.

10) Heart Disease - Diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis and other cardiac issues due to vascular damage.

11) Smoking History- Nicotine reduces insulin sensitivity, and smoking promotes inflammation.

12) HbA1c Level- High HbA1c levels confirm poor glucose regulation and increased risk of complications.

Problem Statement
The challenge is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not using the above features. Accurate predictions can help in early diagnosis and proper intervention, leading to better health outcomes.
